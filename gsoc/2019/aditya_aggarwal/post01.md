# Hello Everyone!

May 15, 2019

I am Aditya Aggarwal, currently a junior at International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India. I am very passionate about Computer Vision and Robotics. This year I will be working on Face Identification Component using Incremental learning techniques for Robocomp and this is my introductory post.


## Project Description
One of the real capacities that a robot must almost certainly perform while interacting with humans is to distinguish between individuals effectively and simultaneously be able to meet and learn new peopleâ€™s identity. This will allow a more enriched interaction between robots and humans and also help robot to make a better decision based on the input from different categories of people.

So in order to achieve this goal, the objective of this project is to develop a People Identification System which should be able to perform the following operations:

- Identify known people: Robot should be able to identify the people which it has already interacted with earlier.

- Classify new people: Be able to recognize new people around itself and then remember him/her for future.
